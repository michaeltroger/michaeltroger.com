# michaeltroger.com - Personal Website of Michael Troger
This repository is representing the source code of my private website https://michaeltroger.com that is hosted on GitHub.
The website is powered by Jekyll and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It is based on [Jonathan McGlone’s](https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io/) project.

This project on purpose does not provide a license. That means it is under my exclusive copyright.
The reason for that being that 99% of this repo is private data of myself.

Therefore I would recommend to use [Jonathan McGlone’s](https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io/) project as a starter, since it doesn't contain any private information and the author allows copying without restrictions.

### Instructions
