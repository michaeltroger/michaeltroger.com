Personal website including a blog - hosted on GitHub

This repository is representing the source code of my website https://michaeltroger.github.io

It's mainly used to promote projects of mine with an integrated blog. This website is powered by Jekyll and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It is based on [Jonathan McGlone’s](https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io/) project.
