# michaeltroger.com - Personal Website of Michael Troger
This repository is representing the source code of my website https://michaeltroger.com that is hosted on Github.
This website is powered by Jekyll and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It is based on [Jonathan McGloneâ€™s](https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io/) project.

Users are free to copy and re-use the code contained here without contacting me.
But please don't host the website on any public server without removing my personal data like name, address, email address, profile links (like Linkedin) and photos first.
