# michaeltroger.com - Personal Website of Michael Troger
[![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/michaeltroger/michaeltroger.com/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michaeltroger/michaeltroger.com/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)

This repository is representing the **source code of my private website https://michaeltroger.com** that is hosted with GitHub Pages.
The website is powered by Jekyll and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It is based on [Jonathan McGlone’s](https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io/) project.

## License
This project on purpose does not provide a license. That means it is **under my exclusive copyright**.
The reason for that being that **99% of this repo is private data** of myself.

Therefore I would recommend to use [Jonathan McGlone’s](https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io/) project as a starter, since it doesn't contain any private information and the author allows copying without restrictions.

While you're not allowed to use my personal data, you're free to check how things are done technically and it's ok to re-use the techniques in your project.
You don't need to ask for permission for this. If providing my website as open source proved helpful for you, then I'd be happy about a referral though!

## Instructions
GitHub Pages builds automatically on commits. Files can directly be edited within the GitHub UI.

### Local development:
`jekyll serve` builds and serves the page at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
