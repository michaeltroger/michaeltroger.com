# michaeltroger.com - Personal Website of Michael Troger
[![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/michaeltroger/michaeltroger.com/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michaeltroger/michaeltroger.com/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)

This repository is representing the **source code of my private website https://michaeltroger.com** that is hosted with GitHub Pages.
The website is powered by Jekyll and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It is based on [Jonathan McGlone’s](https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io/) project.

## License
This project on purpose does not provide a license. That means it is **under my exclusive copyright**.
The reason for that being that **99% of this repo is private data** of myself.

Therefore I would recommend to use [Jonathan McGlone’s](https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io/) project as a starter, since it doesn't contain any private information and the author allows copying without restrictions.

## Instructions
GitHub Pages builds automatically on commits. Files can directly be edited within the GitHub UI.

### Local deployment
`jekyll serve` builds and serves the page at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
