## Data Collected When Visiting This Website
I do not actively collect any data about visitors.  
However, to deliver the website to your browser, certain technical information — such as your IP address — must be processed temporarily by the companies providing the network and hosting infrastructure.  
I do not have access to this data and do not receive any visitor statistics or logs.

This technically required processing is based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR — legitimate interest in the proper functionality and delivery of the website.

Under the GDPR, you generally have rights of access, rectification, and deletion regarding personal data. However, since I do not store or have access to any personal data of website visitors, these rights cannot be exercised in relation to this website.

## Third-Party Infrastructure

### Registrar & Name Server
[OVH SAS](https://www.ovhcloud.com), a French company,
is my registrar and name server provider. They translate the domain name into the actual IP address of the host.

OVH will receive your IP address. This is required for a proper functionality of the website and a technical need.
You can read the [OVH privacy policy](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/terms-and-conditions/privacy-policy/) for further information.

### Hosting
The website is hosted by [GitHub, Inc.](https://github.com), a U.S. company.  
GitHub (and its subprocessors such as Content Delivery Networks) receives your IP address and request details to deliver the website correctly.  

You can read the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#data-collection) and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement) for details.  

The list of [GitHub subprocessors](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-subprocessors) is publicly available.  
GitHub participates in the [EU–U.S. Data Privacy Framework](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov).

An external link is any link that does not point to this website. Links to external sources are marked with an icon (except image links such as “Get it on Google Play”). Please check the link target before clicking. If you leave my website via an external link, I cannot guarantee the same level of privacy. I am not responsible for the content or data processing practices of external websites.
