## What Data Is Processed
I do not actively collect or store personal data about visitors.

When you access this website, your browser automatically transmits certain technical data (such as your IP address and request details) to the **hosting and DNS providers**.  
This data is processed solely to deliver and secure the website and is automatically deleted after a short period.

The legal basis for this processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR — my legitimate interest in providing a secure and functional website.

The hosting and DNS providers (GitHub and OVH) process connection data as independent controllers for their respective infrastructure services.

You have rights of access, rectification, and erasure under the GDPR; however, this website itself does not store any personal data.
