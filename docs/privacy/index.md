# Privacy Policy

I purposely chose to neither use cookies nor analytics on this website.
On top of that, this website does not include any resources from other web servers at all. 
While this might limit the functionality of the website, it also shows that I care about your privacy.

## Contact Data
Michael Troger, MSc.

## Which data is collected when using this website?
I don't do any data collection and I do not have access to any personal data about your visit. 
However, due to the way the internet works, with your page request, your IP address is sent together with some other information, like the requested URL and so called Headers, to the server hosting this website.
I'm not the owner of the web server, but I will be very transparent on how the setup looks like and which parties are involved:

### - Registrar
My domains are registered at [OVH SAS](https://www.ovhcloud.com), a French company.
Since they only serve as registrar, they would not be involved in data collection.

### - Name Server
I use the services of [Cloudflare, Inc.](https://www.cloudflare.com), a US company with servers all around the world,
to translate the website's domain name into the actual IP address of the host.

Cloudflare will receive your IP address. This is required for a proper functionality of the website and a technical need.
You can find the [full privacy policy of Cloudflare here](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) for further information.
The service that I use from them is only the name server.

Cloudflare is part of the [EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov).

### - Hosting
The website is hosted by [GitHub, Inc.](https://github.com), a US company.
The reason I chose this host, is that I as a programmer really like the way I can deploy my website from open source code.

GitHub, and potentially its subprocessors, will receive your IP address, together with your request details. This is needed for proper technical functionality.
You can read the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#data-collection)
and the [full privacy policy of GitHub here](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement)
for more information about their data usage. 
The service that I use from them is called GitHub Pages.

The list of [subprocessors of GitHub can be found here](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-subprocessors). A subprocessor is e.g. a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like Fastly.

GitHub is part of the [EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov).

## External Links
Definition: An external link is any link that does not target {{ site.url }}.

Links to external sources are explicitly marked with an additional icon next to them,
with the exception of image links like the "Get it on Google Play" banner and similar.
To be 100% sure, please check the target URL of a link, before clicking it.
If you leave my website through any external link, I can not guarantee the same level of privacy as on my own website.

## Contact Form
The contact form just opens your email client. I do not receive any data until you actually decide to send me an email.

## Open Source
The [source code of the website]({{ site.website_source_url }}) is fully Open Source, which allows you to check the website's functionality and behavior.

## Does the website have any ads?
No.

## Does the website do any kind of tracking?
No, there is no tracking.

## Email Provider
My email provider is [mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org), operated by the German company Heinlein Hosting GmbH.

## Up-to-Dateness of this Policy
This policy is currently valid and was created in March, 2024. Since the website will be updated from time to time, I might also update this policy.
The current policy will always be available at this URL. The policy is [open-source]({{ site.website_source_root_url }}{{ page.path }}) like the rest of the website, so you can also check the history of changes.
