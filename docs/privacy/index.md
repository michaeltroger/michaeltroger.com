# Privacy Policy

I purposely chose to neither use cookies nor analytics on this website.
On top of that, this website does not include any resources from other web servers at all. 
While this might limit the functionality of the website, it also shows that I care about your privacy.

## Which data is collected when using this website?
I don't do any data collection and I do not have access to any personal data about your visit. 
However, due to the way the internet works, with your page request, your IP address is sent together with some other information, like the requested URL and so called Headers, to the server hosting this website.
Although I am not the owner of the server, I can promise you that I put effort into assuring as much anonymity as possible for you. Also I will be very transparent on how the setup looks like and which parties are involved:

### - Registrar
My domains are registered at [OVH GmbH](https://www.ovhcloud.com), a European company.
Since they only serve as registrar, they would not be involved in data collection.

### - Name Server & Proxy
I use the services of [Cloudflare, Inc.](https://www.cloudflare.com), an American company with servers all around the world,
for managing the Domain Name System (DNS) and as proxy to forward your requests to the actual webhost.
The advantage of such proxy is that requests can be answered from a location close to your own, which decreases load time and increases security.

Cloudflare will receive your IP address along with your request details. This is required for a proper functionality of the website and a technical need.
You can find the [full privacy policy of Cloudflare here](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) for further information.
The services that I use from them are the name server and the Cloudflare Proxy.

Cloudflare is part of the [EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov).

### - Hosting
The website is hosted by [GitHub, Inc.](https://github.com), an American company.
The reason I chose this host is that I as a programmer really like the way I can deploy my website from open source code.

Cloudflare has an option to not expose the visitor IP  to the host (in this case GitHub), which I enabled.
So it is most certain that GitHub will not receive your IP, but the one from Cloudflare only.
Since this is not fully in my hands,
I still want to share the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#data-collection) for more information about their data usage.
Generally speaking, a web host will always need an IP and request details for proper technical functionality.
You can find the [full privacy policy of GitHub here](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).
The service that I use from them is called GitHub Pages.

## Further Measures Taken for Security and Privacy
The connection to the proxy (Cloudflare) and further to the hoster (GitHub) are both fully encrypted with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
I have a very strict Content Security Policy (CSP) in place, which disallows the execution of other resources than from my own domain.
This makes sure your IP is not exposed to any other third party and to not make you trackable.
On Cloudflare I have set-up several things to ensure your privacy towards the hoster: Since they are not needed for the site's functionality, I anonymize your User Agent and Accept Language headers. 
They are sent automatically by your browser. As mentioned in the section "hosting", I also enabled the option to not expose your IP to the hoster.


## External Links
Definition: An external link is any link that does not target {{ site.url }}.

Links to external sources are explicitly marked with an additional icon next to them,
with the exception of image links like the "Get it on Google Play" banner and similar.
To be 100% sure, please check the target URL of a link, before clicking it.
If you leave my website through any external link, I can not guarantee the same level of privacy as on my own website.

## Contact Form
The contact form just opens your email client. I do not receive any data until you actually decide to send me an email.

## Open Source
The [source code of the website]({{ site.website_source_url }}) is fully Open Source, which allows you to check the website's functionality and behavior.

## Does the website have any ads?
No.

## Does the website do any kind of tracking?
No, there is no tracking.

## Email Provider
My email provider is [mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org), operated by the German company Heinlein Hosting GmbH.

## Up-to-Dateness of this Policy
This policy is currently valid and was created in March, 2024. Since the website will be updated from time to time, I might also update this policy.
The current policy will always be available at this URL. The policy is [open-source]({{ site.website_source_root_url }}{{ page.path }}) like the rest of the website, so you can also check the history of changes.
