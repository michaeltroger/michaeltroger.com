<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
I purposely chose to neither use cookies nor analytics on this website.
On top of that, this website does not include any resources from other web servers at all. 
While this might limit the functionality of the website, it also shows that I care about your privacy.
</p>

<h2>Contact Data</h2>

<h2>Which data is collected when using this website?</h2>
<p>I don't do any data collection and I do not have access to any personal data about your visit. 
Due to the way the internet works, with your page request, your IP address is sent together with some other information like the requested URL and so called Headers to the server hosting this website.
Although I am not the owner of the server, I can promise you that I put effort into assuring as much anonymity as possible for you. Also I will be very transparent on how the setup looks like and which parties are involved:
</p>

<h3>- Registrar</h3>
<p>My domains are registered at <a href="https://www.ovhcloud.com">OVH GmbH</a>, a European company. Since they only serve as registrar, they would not be involved in data collection.</p>

<h3>- Name Server & Proxy</h3>
<p>I use the services of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare, Inc.</a>, an American company with servers all around the world, for managing the Domain Name System (DNS) and as proxy to forward your requests to the actual webhost.
The advantage of such proxy is that requests can be answered from a location close to your own, which decreases load time and increases security. </p>
<p>Cloudflare will receive your IP address along with your request details. This is required for a proper functionality of the website and a technical need. You can find the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">full privacy policy of Cloudflare here</a> for further information. The services that I use from them are the name server and the Cloudflare Proxy.</p>
<p>Cloudflare is part of the <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov">EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework</a>.</p>

<h3>- Hosting</h3>
<p>The website is hosted by <a href="https://github.com">GitHub, Inc.</a>, an American company.
The reason I chose this host is that I as a programmer really like the way I can deploy my website from open source code.</p>
<p>Cloudflare has an option to not expose the visitor IP  to the host (in this case GitHub), which I enabled.
So it is most certain that GitHub will not receive your IP, but the one from Cloudflare only.
Since this is not fully in my hands, I still want to share the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#data-collection">GitHub Pages documentation</a> for more information about their data usage. Generally speaking, a web host will always need an IP and request details for proper technical functionality. You can find the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement">full privacy policy of GitHub here</a>. The service that I use from them is called GitHub Pages.</p>

<h2>Further Measures Taken for Security and Privacy</h2>
<p>The connection to the proxy (Cloudflare) and further to the hoster (GitHub) are both fully encrypted with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
I have a very strict Content Security Policy (CSP) in place, which disallows the execution of other resources than from my own domain.
This makes sure your IP is not exposed to any other third party and to not make you trackable.
On Cloudflare I have set-up several things to ensure your privacy towards the hoster: Since they are not needed for the site's functionality, I anonymize your User Agent and Accept Language headers. 
They are sent automatically by your browser. As mentioned in the section "hosting", I also enabled the option to not expose your IP to the hoster.
</p>

<h2>External Links</h2>
<p>Links to external sources are explicitly marked with an additional icon next to them.
The only exception being image links like the "get it on Google Play" banners and similar.
If you leave my website through any of those external links, I can not guarantee the same level of privacy as on my website.
</p>

<h2>Contact Form</h2>
<p>
The contact form just opens your email client. I do not receive any data until you actually decide to send me an email.
Since email is not the most secure way of communication, I decided to encrypt the message content before passing it to your email client.
This way neither your email provider, nor your internet provider can read the message content. And neither will mine be able to do so.
Only I will be able to decrypt and read it.
</p>

<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/michaeltroger/michaeltroger.com">source code of the website</a> is fully Open Source, which allows you to check the website's functionality and behavior.</p> 

<h2>Does the website have any ads?</h2>
<p>No.</p>

<h2>Does the website do any kind of tracking?</h2>
<p>No, there is no tracking.</p>

<h2>Email</h2>
<p>In case you send me an email, you might want to know, who has access to the data.
My email provider is <a href="https://mailbox.org">Mailbox.org</a>, a German email service with a focus on security and privacy.
Mailbox.org has an option to automatically encrypt all incoming emails, which I enabled. Therefore it is ensured that, on my end, no one else than me can read your email content. You can find the <a href="https://mailbox.org/en/data-protection">full privacy policy of Mailbox.org here</a> for further information.</p>
<p>Note that email is generally not the most secure way of communication, so e.g. your email client or your email provider might still have access to the message content.</p>
<p>Furthermore, meta information like your (and my) email address with their associated contact name and the email subject will be visible to both our email providers. This is the way emails work and it's technically not possible to avoid this part.
</p>
<p>
Anyhow, if possible I would always recommend end-to-end encryption for your emails, since this is the most secure way of email communication.
You can use my <a href="/contact">contact form</a> to send me an end-to-end encrypted email, if you want to. This will ensure that neither your email provider, nor mine can read the message body.
When encrypting an email, I would recommend to use a generic email subject like "Encrypted message" or to leave the subject out in the first place.
This way at least your message body is fully private and the subject does not give away any information.
For advanced, technically interested users, I also offer my encryption key on the <a href="/contact">contact page</a>.</p>

<h2>Signal</h2>
<p>If you choose to contact me through the Signal messenger, then your message will be end-to-end encrypted, which allows a secure way of communication. Only I will be able to read your message.
You can find the <a href="https://signal.org/legal/">full privacy policy of Signal here</a>.</p>

<h2>Up-to-Dateness of this Policy</h2>
<p>
This policy is currently valid and was created in March, 2024. Since the website will be updated from time to time, I might also update this policy.
The current policy will always be available at this URL. The policy is <a href="https://github.com/michaeltroger/michaeltroger.com/blob/master/docs/privacy/index.html">open-source</a> like the rest of the website, so you can also check the history of changes.
