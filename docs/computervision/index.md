# Computer Vision on Android
In my studies I had courses like Computer Graphics, Digital Imaging and Computer Vision.
I was lucky to be able to gain practical experience in Computer Vision, in my time abroad in Belgium, where I worked for 3 months with Android based smartglasses.
In the course of the work at the applied research IT department of [Hogeschol PXL](https://www.pxl.be/),
I created several Computer Vision / Augmented Reality projects for Android that I still maintain:   

* [Simple shape detector](https://github.com/michaeltroger/shape-detection-android)
* [Template Matching:<br>Sum of squared differences](https://github.com/michaeltroger/template-matching-android)
* [Template Matching with NDK/Coroutines:<br>Feature Matching - Brute-Force Matching with ORB Descriptors](https://github.com/michaeltroger/feature-matching-native-android)
* [Template Matching:<br>Feature Matching - Brute-Force Matching with ORB Descriptors](https://github.com/michaeltroger/feature-matching-android)
