# Computer Vision on Android
During my studies, I took courses such as Computer Graphics, Digital Imaging, and Computer Vision. I was fortunate to gain practical experience in Computer Vision during my time abroad in Belgium, where I worked for three months with Android-based smart glasses. As part of my work in the applied research IT department at [Hogeschool PXL](https://www.pxl.be/), I created several Computer Vision and Augmented Reality projects for Android that I still maintain:

* [Simple Shape Detector](https://github.com/michaeltroger/shape-detection-android)
* [Template Matching:<br>Sum of Squared Differences](https://github.com/michaeltroger/template-matching-android)
* [Template Matching with NDK/Coroutines:<br>Feature Matching — Brute-Force Matching with ORB Descriptors](https://github.com/michaeltroger/feature-matching-native-android)
* [Template Matching:<br>Feature Matching — Brute-Force Matching with ORB Descriptors](https://github.com/michaeltroger/feature-matching-android)
