title: Michael Troger's IT Setup
---
<h1>My IT Setup</h1>
<p>On this page I'm offering some <b>insides</b> on how my <b>technical setup as a professional Software Developer</b> looks like. 
The use of many tools is very opinion based and so my recommendations can be considered subjective.</p>
<h2>Operating System</h2>
<p>
While I'm using macOS at work, I'm using Linux on my private machine. If I would have to choose one, I would without a doubt go for Linux.
Especially as a Software Engineer.
I'm a Linux user since many years. Like for many it started with Ubuntu. Nowadays I'm on <b>EndeavourOS</b>, a rolling release based on Arch Linux.
I don't dual boot with Windows, but I have a Windows VM for the very, very few cases where I need it (updating firmware of some devices).
From software development to gaming I do all on my Linux machine. As you know for Linux there are different desktop environments to choose from. My absolute favorite is <b>KDE Plasma</b>.
</p>
<h2>IDE</h2>
<p>
As an Android Developer my IDE of choice is <b>Android Studio</b>. For anything related to web, I'm using Visual Studio Code. For almost all other development I'm using IntelliJ IDEA. 
</p>
<h2>Shell</h2>
<p>
My shell of choice since probably a decade is <b>Oh My Zsh</b>. It allows me to be very productive and I appreciate its customization options.
</p>
<h2>Software Sources</h2>
<p>
With Arch Linux there are lots of different ways to install applications. My favorite way is <b>Flatpak</b>, since I like its sandboxing approach and the interoperability with other Linux distributions a lot.
For performance reasons I use some KDE apps (so fitting to my desktop environment) natively, but most of my other apps would be Flatpaks. The AUR I use only for exceptional cases like for some special hardware driver.
The JetBrains Toolbox for managing IntelliJ IDEs, I install directly from JetBrains.
