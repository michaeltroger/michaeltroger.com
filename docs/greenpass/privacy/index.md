## In-app purchases
Our app offers optional in-app purchases. Purchases and payments are processed securely by Google Play and are subject to Google’s Privacy Policy. We do not receive or store any payment information such as credit card details.

## Which other data is collected when using the app?
**The app works fully offline and all document data gathered by the app stays on the device**, and is not transmitted to our or any third party servers.
That means we do not have access to your personal data.
Following you can find more information about how data is used **on your device**:

### - Importing documents explained
The chosen PDF document is copied into the app's storage space and is solely read out for display.
The app does not sensually grasp the document's content. 
I.e. for the app it makes no difference if you import a health related certificate or a bus ticket.

To enable the fullscreen display of the barcode, the document's pages are searched visually (not textually), if there is any barcode inside.
The text content of the barcode is read out by the app at runtime and solely used for creation of the fullscreen barcode.
The barcode search functionality is optional and can be disabled in the app's settings.

The document's data does at no point leave the app and can be removed from the app storage at any time, 
by deleting the document with the delete functionality of the app or by uninstalling the app.
Other apps have no access to the document in the app's space.
  
### - Handling of password protected PDFs explained
After inserting the password for decryption, the document stays permanently (until deletion by the user) decrypted in the app's storage.
Your password is solely used for decryption and is not saved or sent anywhere.
  
## Open Source
The [source code of the app](https://github.com/michaeltroger/pdfwallet-android) is fully Open Source, which allows you to check the app's functionality and behavior.

## Does the app have any ads?
No, there are no ads.

## Does the app do any kind of tracking?
No, there is no tracking.
  
## Which permissions does this app need? To what device capabilities has this app access?
This app optionally allows to authenticate via fingerprint sensor. Other than that the app requires no permissions at all.
Therefore it has also no access to things like internet, camera, or other (not imported) files on your device, etc.
The app can solely access the currently imported documents.

## Rooted devices
It is not recommended to use the app on so called rooted devices. Root access potentially allows other apps to access your otherwise safe documents.

## External links
Definition: An external link is any URL in the app, marked with the "open in new" icon next to it.

Since the app itself does not have internet access, links will be opened in your default browser.
An external link can also be handled by one of your other installed apps, like e.g. for rating the app it is usually your app store.
When you leave the app through such an external link, then I can not guarantee the same level of privacy as in my own app. 

## Up-to-Dateness of this Policy
This policy is currently valid and was created in September, 2025. Since the app will be updated from time to time, I might also update this policy.
The current policy will always be available at this URL. The policy is [open-source]({{ site.website_source_root_url }}{{ page.path }}) like the rest of the app, so you can also check the history of changes.
