<h2>Which data is collected when using the app?</h2>
<p><b>All data gathered by the app stays on the device</b>, and is not transmitted to our or any third party servers.
Following you can find more information about how data is used <b>on the device</b>:
</p>
<h3>- Importing documents explained</h3>
<p>
The chosen PDF document is copied into the app's storage space and is solely read out for display.
The app does not sensually grasp the document's content. 
I.e. for the app it makes no difference if you import a health related certificate or a bus ticket.
<br>
To enable the fullscreen display of the QR code, the document's pages are searched visually (not textually), if there is any QR code inside.
The text content of the QR code is read out by the app at runtime and soleley used for creation of the fullscreen QR code.
The QR code search functionality is optional and can be disabled in the app's settings.
<br>
The document's data does at no point leave the app and can be removed from the app storage at any time, 
by deleting the document with the delete functionality of the app or by uninstalling the app.
Other apps have no access to the document in the app's space.
</p>
  
<h3>- Handling of password protected PDFs explained</h3>
<p>
After inserting the password for decryption, the document stays permanently (until deletion by the user) decrypted in the app's storage.
Your password is solely used for decryption and is not saved or sent anywhere.</p>
  
<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/michaeltroger/greenpass-android">Source code of the app</a> is fully Open Source, which allows you to check the app's functionality and behavior.</p> 

<h2>Does the app have any ads?</h2>
<p>No, there are no ads.</p>

<h2>Does the app do any kind of tracking?</h2>
<p>No, there is no tracking.</p>
  
<h2>Which permissions does this app need?
<br>To what device capabilities has this app access?</h2>
<p>
This app optionally allows to authenticate via fingerprint sensor. Other than that the app requires no permissions at all.
Therefore it has also no access to things like internet, camera, or other (not imported) files on your device, etc.
The app can solely access the currently imported documents. 
</p>

<h2>Up-to-Dateness of this Policy</h2>
<p>
This policy is currently valid and was created in March, 2024. Since the app will be updated from time to time, I might also update this policy.
The current policy will always be available at this URL. The policy is <a href="https://github.com/michaeltroger/michaeltroger.com/blob/master/docs/greenpass/privacy/index.html">open-source</a> like the rest of the app, so you can also check the history of changes.
