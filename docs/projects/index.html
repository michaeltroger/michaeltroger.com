<h1>My Projects</h1>
<p>Although being a professional software developer, programming stayed a hobby of mine. Therefore I'm working on some projects in my free-time.
Following a selected list of Android projects that I actively maintain, described in more detail: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/greenpass">Green Pass PDF Wallet</a></li>
  <li><a href="/latintocyrillic">Cyrillic Transliterator: Latin To Cyrillic</a></li>
  <li><a href="/computervision">Multiple Computer Vision Apps</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of them you can also find on my <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8534329847513004090">Google Play Developer page</a>.</p>
<h2>Web development and hosting</h2>
<p>Besides Android development, I host and maintain this, and a couple of other small websites. 
I also manage the domains and do their domain name system (DNS) configuration.
Currently I'm having only static websites, hosted on GitHub Pages, except one with shared hosting on OVH servers.
</p>

<h1>Archived (section is in progress)</h1>
<p>Over the years I worked on dozens of different projects and technologies which I don't actively maintain anymore.
Since plenty of my life time went into them, I still want to mention them here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>lerne-kroatisch.de was a website and community based on the Drupal CMS</li>
  <li>autotechnik-troger.at is a website based on Wordpress. I host and maintain it still, 
    but since a couple of years it's only in maintainance mode (for software updates)</li>
  <li>freie-schule.at was a website based on the Contao CMS, my focus was on the CMS configuration and the templates, while a colleague worked on the designs</li>
  <li>Shribe was a chat app created during my studies, together with 2 colleagues. It was based on WebSockets. The client was based on vanilla JavaScript. I worked on the backend part with Node.js</li>
  <li>During my studies I developed a restaurant reservation web application, together with 2 colleagues. I worked on the frontend web application part with Angular 2 and TypeScript</li>
  <li>For my Master thesis I created an Android app for collecting sensor data like from the accelerometer and the gyroscope</li>
  <li>For my Bachelor thesis I created an augmented virtuality video chat for the browser. It was based on WebRTC and WebGL technology</li>
  <li>During my studies I created an augmented reality endless runner game. It was written with the help of Unity</li>
  <li>My personal website was earlier running on plain PHP/MySQL. Later it was based on Node.js and Express</li>
  <li>I used to run my own virtual server with Ubuntu for webhosting</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>

<h1>Open-Source</h1>
<p>Over the last years I learnt to value open-source software and platforms like Stack Overflow. 
Since they helped me grow as developer, I decided to give something back to the community.
I'm an active member on GitHub and Stack Overflow. Feel free to check out my profiles.

</p>
<p>Additionally I created an automatically generated overview of <a href="/repositories">all my open-source repositories</a>. Excerpt:</p>
<ul>
{% assign repos = site.github.public_repositories %}
{% if repos %}
  {% assign sortedRepos = repos | sort: 'stargazers_count' | reverse %}
  {% for repo in sortedRepos limit:3 %}
    <li><a href="{{ repo.html_url }}">{{ repo.name }}</a>
      {% if repo.description %}
        <br>{{ repo.description }}
      {% endif %}
      <br>Stars: {{ repo.stargazers_count }} | Forks: {{ repo.forks_count }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
{% endif %}
<li><a href="/repositories">See more</a></li>
</ul>
