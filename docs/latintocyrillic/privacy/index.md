## Which data is collected when using the app?
**The app works fully offline and all data gathered by the app stays on the device**, and is not transmitted to our or any third party servers.
That means we do not have access to your personal data.
Following you can find more information about how data is used **on your device**:
* Generally all the app's data can be deleted by uninstalling the app.
* None of the app's data is accessible for other apps. This changes as soon as you actively copy or share a text on your own choice.
* The app optionally allows to automatically copy the converted text to your clipboard. Keep in mind that text in the clipboard can potentially be accessed by other apps.
* The app by default remembers the last inserted text when you re-open the app. This can be disabled in the app's settings. You can also use the delete functionality to clear the last remembered text.
* If you created a custom conversion table and you want to delete it, then you can overwrite it with an empty one.
  
## Open Source
The [source code of the app](https://github.com/michaeltroger/latintocyrillic-android) is fully Open Source, which allows you to check the app's functionality and behavior.

## Does the app have any ads?

## Does the app do any kind of tracking?

## Up-to-Dateness of this Policy
This policy is currently valid and was created in March, 2024. Since the app will be updated from time to time, I might also update this policy.
The current policy will always be available at this URL. The policy is [open-source]({{ site.website_source_root_url }}{{ page.path }}) like the rest of the app, so you can also check the history of changes.
