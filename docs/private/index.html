<h1>Private</h1>
<p>I'm a positive, calm and open-minded person living in Puchenau, Austria.
Originally I come from the Austrian federal state Tyrol.
While I'm born in Austria, I like to consider myself as a European.
Throughout my life I was lucky to get to know people from all over the world. From Brasil, India and the Netherlands to name just a few.
</p>
<p>
In my free-time I enjoy being outdoors and doing sports.
Since I was a kid, I am fascinated by computers and IT and I always try to stay up-to-date about things.
My interests include things like playing board games, playing video games and watching TV shows.</p>
<p>
I'm not on any social media network. So if you see any profiles with my name on Facebook / Instagram etc., then that's not me. You can easily contact me through this website though. I'd be happy about <a href="/contact">a message</a>, if we lost track from each other over the years or to get to know each other.
