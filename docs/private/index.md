# Private
I'm a positive, calm and open-minded person living in Puchenau, Austria.
Originally I come from the Austrian federal state Tyrol.
While I'm born in Austria, I like to consider myself as a European rather than an Austrian.
Throughout my life I was lucky to get to know people from all over the world. From Brasil, India and the Netherlands to name just a few.

In my free-time I enjoy being outdoors and doing sports.
I like to go for a run, or to go for a hike with my girlfriend and my friends.
Since I was a kid, I am fascinated by computers and IT and ever since I try to stay up-to-date about things.
My interests include things like playing board games, playing video games and reading books.

I'm not on any social media network. So if you see any profiles with my name on Facebook / Instagram etc. then that's not me. You can easily contact me through this website though. I'd be happy about [a message](/contact), if we lost track from each other over the years or to get to know each other.
