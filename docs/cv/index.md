I was lucky to try many more technologies (e.g. JavaScript, C#, C++, Unity, Python, Scala, Node.js) in different projects, but the technologies above I'm currently most confident with. From my experience a good developer can handle learning a new programming language or tool rather quickly since the concepts are mostly similar.

  
# CV
I earned my **Bachelor's degree** in **Media Technology and Design**, where I specialized in Online and Interactive Media.
During my Bachelor studies I worked for a semester abroad in Belgium to perform applied research, as a developer for augmented reality applications for Android. 
For my thesis I developed an augmented virtuality video chat for the browser. 
In that time I also gained my first work experience as a web developer in new media agencies.


Following that I earned my **Master's degree** in **Mobile Computing** where my thesis engaged with Machine Learning based on smartphone sensor data. 
After my studies I then switched also professionally fully from Web Development to Software Development.

For more than 7 years I worked as **Software Engineer** (Android) at **adidas Digital Sports** (formerly adidas Runtastic), where I gained lots of knowledge, working in an international Scrum team.
Working on Adidas apps as well as on in-house libraries, the job allowed me to write code that is used by millions of sports users worldwide.
I especially appreciated being able to work with state of the art technologies.

Since 2025 I work at **Bora**, where I continue my software engineering journey by developing software for kitchen hardware.
