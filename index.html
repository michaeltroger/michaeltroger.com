<h1>Hi there, I'm Michael Troger!</h1>
<p>I'm from Puchenau, Austria. Developing interactive applications for the web as well as for Android is my passion.</p>
<p>I earned my Bachelor's degree in Media Technology and Design, where I specialized in Online and Interactive Media.
During my Bachelor studies I worked for a semester abroad in Belgium, as a developer for augmented reality applications for Android. 
For my thesis I developed an augmented virtuality video chat for the browser. 
In that time I also gained my first work experience as a web developer in new media agencies.
</p>
<p>
Following that I earned my Master's degree in Mobile Computing where my thesis engaged with Machine Learning based on smartphone sensor data. 
After my studies I then switched fully from Web Development to Software Development. 
Currently I'm a Senior Software Engineer (Android) at Adidas Runtastic, where I gained lots of knowledge, working in an international Scrum team.
</p>
<p>I'm not on any Social Media, so you won't find me there, but feel free to just send me an email to get in touch :-)</p>
