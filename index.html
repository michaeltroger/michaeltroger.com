<h1>Hi there, I'm Michael Troger!</h1>
<p>I'm from Puchenau, Austria. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Media Technology and Design, where I specialized in Online and Interactive Media.
Developing interactive applications for the web as well as for Android is my passion. For my Bachelor's thesis I developed an augmented virtuality video chat for the browser. 
Besides my work experience as a web developer in new media agencies, I worked for a semester abroad in Belgium as a developer for augmented reality applications for Android.
Following that I earned my Master's degree in Mobile Computing. After my studies I switched from Web Development to Software Development. 
Meanwhile I'm a Senior Software Engineer (Android) at Adidas Runtastic, where I gained lots of knowledge in an international Scrum team.
