<h1>My Projects</h1>
<p>Although being a professional software developer, programming stayed a hobby of mine. Therefore I'm working on some projects in my free-time.
Following a selected list of Android projects that I actively maintain: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/greenpass">Green Pass PDF Wallet</a></li>
  <li><a href="/latintocyrillic">Cyrillic Transliterator: Latin To Cyrillic</a></li>
  <li><a href="/computervision">Multiple Computer Vision Apps</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Over the last years I learnt to value open-source software and platforms like Stack Overflow. 
Since they helped me grow as developer, I decided giving something back to the community.
I'm an active member on GitHub and Stack Overflow. Feel free to check out my profiles.
</p>
<p>Additionally I created an automatically updated overview of <a href="/repositories">all my open-source repositories</a>.</p>
