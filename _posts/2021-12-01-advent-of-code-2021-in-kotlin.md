This year, for the first time I decided to participate at the Advent of Code puzzle challenge. While I knew some friends were participating before, I somehow never found the time or I just was not motivated enough.
What changed this year? I heard friends speaking enthusiastically about it and it's promoted quite strongly in the developer community in the web. What was an extra motivation was that [Jetbrains/Kotlin is a main sponsor](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2021/11/advent-of-code-2021-in-kotlin/).
Solving puzzles in my favorite programming language sounded like fun. A Kotlin developer also provides [a nice template project](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/advent-of-code-kotlin-template) to get started, which I found very useful to save some time. For preparation I watched some [solutions from 2020](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/advent-of-code.html), presented by the Kotlin team.

### The Plan
I'm not too much experienced with solving puzzles and coding challenges, so I don't have too high expectations. Also for the global competition, the timezone isn't too comfortable for me and I prefer solving them when I find time. **My focus** will lay on **solving the problems in an ideomatic, nicely readable way**. Providing solutions with as less code as possible and being as quick as possible are non-goals for me. I'll try to provide my solutions on the same day the puzzles start, but I can't promise it due to work and private life potentially interfering.

[**All my solutions of 2021 can be found on GitHub**](https://github.com/michaeltroger/advent-of-code-2021-in-kotlin).
