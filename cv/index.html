I was lucky to try many more technologies (e.g. JavaScript, C#, C++, Unity, Python, Scala, Node.js) in different projects, but the technologies above I'm currently most confident with. From my experience a good developer can handle learning a new programming language or tool rather quickly since the concepts are mostly similar.

<h1 id="cv">CV</h1>
<p>I earned my Bachelor's degree in <b>Media Technology and Design</b>, where I specialized in Online and Interactive Media.
During my Bachelor studies I worked for a semester abroad in Belgium to perform applied research, as a developer for augmented reality applications for Android. 
For my thesis I developed an augmented virtuality video chat for the browser. 
In that time I also gained my first work experience as a web developer in new media agencies.
</p>
<p>
Following that I earned my Master's degree in <b>Mobile Computing</b> where my thesis engaged with Machine Learning based on smartphone sensor data. 
After my studies I then switched also professionally fully from Web Development to Software Development.</p>
<p>
Currently I'm a <b>Senior Software Engineer</b> (Android) at <b>Adidas Runtastic</b>, where I gained lots of knowledge, working in an international Scrum team. 
Working on Adidas apps as well as on in-house libraries, the job allows me to write code that is used by millions of sports users worldwide. 
I especially appreciate being able to work with state of the art technologies.
